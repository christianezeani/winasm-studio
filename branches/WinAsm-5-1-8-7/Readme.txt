V5.1.7.xxx
----------
-Two new flags on the menu dialog of the Visual RC editor: MF_RIGHTJUSTIFY,MF_DEFAULT (SeaFarer) 
	As a consequence, a new version of the MUI dll for each language supported is needed.
	CONTROL "MF_DISABLED",18,"Button",0x50010003,10,132,74,9,0x00000000

----------
-Menu item shortcuts are now saved a Ctrl+Shift+... and not Shift+Ctrl+...

-File - Print Accelrator fixed

-TAB / ...+TAB menu shortcuts are now displayed properly on the menu dialog of the visual RC Editor.

-FASM: since procs are not recognized, they are not only noncollapsed, but also are not added
into the list of blocks and do not appeared in the combobox to fast jumping.(shoorick)
1.collapsing blocks proc, struct and macro:
- proc and struct: instead of masm they are macros (not embedded),
so, are the first word in the line (not second). i think, if you check
both positions you will support both compilers at once. macro is also
the first word, but there little more difficulty: macros in fasm (as i
understood) are single-lined and multy-lined. in last case there are
opening { end closing } (i hate these brackets, but what can i do!)...
so, i have no ideas in this. but, i started from collaping because i
think this is more easy, but in real it could be left at all as is!
[ASSEMBLER]
;FASM
Proc=proc $
EndP=endp
Macro=macro $

blues
it seems like there are some statusbar styles missing, as follows:


CODE  

SBARS_SIZEGRIP     0x0100
SBARS_TOOLTIPS     0x0800
CCS_VERT           0x00000080L
CCS_LEFT           (CCS_VERT | CCS_TOP)
CCS_RIGHT          (CCS_VERT | CCS_BOTTOM)
CCS_NOMOVEX        (CCS_VERT | CCS_NOMOVEY)
 



 
those starting with CCS_ apply also to toolbars (also missing).
additionally, some of the statusbar styles don't behave correctly as far as i know.
for example (in winasm resource editor) CCS_TOP and CCS_BOTTOM go in pairs, if you check one the other is checked as well, and viceversa; CCS_NOMOVEY cannot be unchecked unless both CCS_TOP and CCS_BOTTOM are unchecked... 

-Improvements for scrollbars and statusbars after styles changes

-Dialog/Control styles are now sorted in descending order, when higher styles exist , the lower ones are set to No. e.g. style=3 cause style=1 and style=2 to be displayed as no on the styles list.
 
-Tooltip active parameter color (Thanks PhoBos, shoorick, lamer, blues Mark Jones)

-Moving or sizing a control on a dialog caused flickering;fixed

-Test Dialog when DS_CENTER, if Test dialog height or width was bigger than screen dimensions,  was NOT positioned properly

-tab indicators doesnt seem to do anything in the latest version;fixed-->new CodeHi.dll(Thanks Artoo, blues)

-So, we have three buttons and only one #define for the very first button  
 The one only solution - manualy edit RC file, adding needed defines.
 Once I tried to copy and paste 96 statics (Thanks lamer)

-sometimes I can type, the cursor moves to the next place before thelast 3 or 4 characters have been shown.(Thanks Artoo, shoorick)

-New Version Info starts with Western Europe charset.Also, WinAsm Studio always goes back to an empty charset selection if I modify the RC in text mode to something other than the set of predefined entries (Thanks Artoo)

For MUI dll developers:
-----------------------
New Strings

V5.0.4.xxx
----------
list on string table and accelarators dialogs are now WS_CLIPCHILDREN

***************************************************
well, a buggy ;) if you open winasm, then open another (i have
usually some opened instances), then if you chose 1'st recent project
from menu (not from the recent projects manager) then will open last
opened project, but not that which name is on the item menu. in
other words, menu items has names from the list from last ini, but
then ini is changed with other instances, and first recent item
opens first project from ini, it could be already not those, written
on it (i hope you understand :D). it should or store real pathes
matching to text on items, or items has to be updated dinamically...
or you can left only recent projects manager, what is not good...
or you can left only some few recent projects - 1..3 - think this
will be enough... or it could be a new submenu, updated dinamically
(as languages submenu)... but i think it would be better store
names matching to the items and have few recent items: even one
could be enough (when winasm just opened - fast open the last of the
last) - all other could be acessed via manager. it is not too bad
bug, but first times i've thought i have hallucinations :D
  
also,if the recent list cleared/filled from empty dinamically, spare
dividers appeared in menu "file". i know it is not easy as looks,
but, i think, it could be solved via simple enabling/disabling
recent projects manager menu item(Thanks shoorick)
***************************************************
-The colapsing PROC statements with a + or - to expand/collapse are great, how about expanding the idea to include a function to select any block of text and do the same, maybe a special 'Bookmark' marking the beginning and end of a colapsable block. I think this could make large files like WinProc (For example) much more readable.(Thanks mrs33,andrew_k)

-And a question i have: When I press CTRL-Space, i get the intellisense list
which is normal; but, is there a hotkey to popup the argument list or
something ? I keep having to retype commas and stuff to get the prompt up,
which is annoying because when i click over to another argument,
the prompt closes again. I don't like having to hold onto Right or Left
to get it make the little tooltip thingy turn a certain argument blue
PS: the fact that you have to do the comma thing or open parenthesis
has always been a pain in the neck for me with other software as well,
e.g. VC++. Ideally I wish the argument prototype tooltip thingy popped up
immediately even when i just positioned my caret in the invoke line!(Thanks Savage,shoorick,Mieuws)

-Intellisense major rewites: when CodeHi splitted, wrong position of tooltip and list

-New CodeHi.dll

-New WAAddIn.inc

-Well, now the toolbox is successfully copying and pasting, but I still hear a computer speaker beep and a small delay (i.e. the text doesnt paste until the beep is done like a second later). Am I alone on this or is it happening to everyone? 
It does it with various CTRL hotkeys (Z,X,C,V,Y,R,Q,A, and also a few other letters that I didn't think even do anything), but curiously not for various others (S,D for example; and others that pull up a popup). 
This applies to all text properties in the dialog editor property box.... that is, except for Caption! Caption acts perfectly normal, so something's working there.(Thanks Savage)

-Large Objects Font uses larger font for several items: Project Explorer, Procedures Combobox, Statusbar etc etc (Thanks iceberg)

-The project tree gives us the ability to rename all the files in a project except the project file itself. Is there anyway this can be changed so that we can rename the actual .wap?(Thanks andrew_k)

-In the explorer window: The dialog created by "Add Files..." should include a string with all possible extensions ".asm;.inc;.rc;.text" for adding quickly a known source file. I hate it to select ".inc" first".(Thanks DarkSoul)

-start to edit first or last line in the listbox in rc editor (for ex.
string list), then (do not complete this!) click on arrow buttons of
scrollband to move this line out from border (eg. if it first - down,
if last - up): new rows will have same image as edited (not repainted)(Thanks shoorick)

V5.0.3.xxx
----------

-You should never see wrong or missing Dividing lines for procedure/macros or structures any more (Thanks Qvasimodo, shoorick, blues)
	
-If no correct UI dll in WinAsm UI folder WinAsm Studio now looks for English (Official)-Thanks Jupiter

-	A new option in 'Project-->Add Object files (*.obj)' menu, allows you to link external object files compiled in other programming languages (i.e. C language). The added object files must have been compiled in COFF format and cannot have the same name than any of the Windows or Modules in the project. 
	I create my resources in the MS Visual Studio visual resource editor. It produces .rc files incompatible with WinAsm. I use .res files instead. But I need to add a blank .rc file with the same name as .res file to the project to make it work(Thanks DELTA_1)

-Changes in Opening Project routine should load big projects faster

-When the caret was not on a word, intellisense replaced the previous word;fixed (Thanks Qvasimodo)

-Constants are inserted only once in the Vaiables and Constants intellisense list no matter how many times one can find them in the vaa files (I like it now)

-ES_AUTOHSCROLL set by default for edit controls (Thanks Qvasimodo)

-A problem im having with intellisense is when i go back to edit an invoke argument, and edit the beginning of the word, the intellisense will popup and cover up the original word and the rest of the line, since it appears right next to the cursor. To make it a lot easier, i think making the intellisense menu so that it pops up one line under the current one is a must. (Thanks Savage)
 
-Intellisense does something that I found strange, when dealing with function parameters. For example, when typing the second parameter to ShowWindowAsync, the popup correctly shows all possible flags. But when I type the letter "n" (I tried to type "nCmdShow", a local variable name), the popup dissapears. The strange part is that if I instead paste the variable name, the popup is shown again (and this time it has local variables and a bunch of unrelated constants). I wasn't sure this behavior was intentional... :?

-both ways: through about box and through F10 led to the main page of the site (not forum). since there two of them, it would be good to have at least one direct to the forum.

For MUI dll developers:

	-From Tools-Interface choose English (Official)/Ελληνικά or any other custom language is provided in the future
	
-New option in Miscellaneous to (not)add quotes to file name to be debugged

-ImageList_LoadImage is used instead of ImageList_Create for 256 colors (16-bit palette) bitmaps
 to correct toolbar buttons images displaying bug (very rare)-(Thanks Lezhik)

-Search button is disabled. It seems that it happens if the project consists of a single file and only when this file starts MAXIMIZED.(Thanks JimG)

-After removing a file from a project, appropriate toolbar buttons were disabled.

-Under certain conditions, Inserting included files for the first time would crash WinAsm Studio

-When i create a new project "Add files..." works perfectly, but if I open an old project "Add files..." doesn't work(Thanks scud)

-Very rare Crash when scrolling fixed (Thanks Mark Jones)

-Ctrl+V in edit control of Properties list was inserting text twice

-Context menu on Docking windows title bar now shows current title style as a checked menu item.
 

(Thanks JimG)
I wanted an empty template just to skip the step of deleting the untitiled.asm file you get by default and answering the two questions about saving the file.
I created the attached empty project by doing a new project and deleting the untitled.asm file and savting it in templates as "Empty".
After doing so, this was the number 1 recent file in WinAsm.ini, and WinAsm would then crash every time I try to start it up. I manually changed the winasm.ini so it wasn't number 1 so I could start up WinAsm again. I though you might want to trap this condition rather than just crashing.

(Thanks JimG)
Also, WinAsm crashes if you just delete the #1 recent file from the ini file

V4.0.4.231

-Invoke LoadBitmap,... instead of Invoke LoadImage,... for image lists of toolbars(Thanks Lezhik)


V4.0.4.229
---------
-Controls Manager now closes with Esc
-The sizes aren't remembered correctly so you have to resize every window every time you reopen a project, which is a real pain if you have split a large project over a number of ASM files and INC files, because the default size is really very small. This info could easily be added to the WAP(Thanks IanB)
-Under certain conditions, several toolbar buttons and menu items were not disabled after closing a project.
-Several incompatible resource script statements are now handled-(Thanks DELTA_1)
	#undef
	#if
	#ifdef
	#pragma
	#endif
	#ifndef
	#elif
	#else
	TEXTINCLUDE
-A bug related to the "Handle incompatible scripts silently" option fixed

-New WAAddIn.inc
	-Dialog menu renamed to Resources menu
	
-Definitions Manager

-Much smoother opening and closing of projects<--------I like it very much now.

-When you have more than one control with the same ID, even across dialogs, deleting one of them removes the ID from the script. (I'm not sure if this one has been reported for earlier versions already, I'm posting just in case it hasn't).(Thanks Qvasimodo)

-Export ID definitions(Thanks shoorick)

-A serious (silly) bug regarding the controls Manager dialog Fixed

-From Visual Mode ON--->off--->ON--->OFF CRASH!!!!! fixed

-A lot of minor fixes

V4.0.3.xx
---------
-A bug when parsing resource ID names longer than 31 chars fixed (Thanks Qvasimodo)
-Override snapping to grids if Alt-key is pressed (Thanks shoorick)
-Double click to add Control(Thanks Jnrz)-->Small rearrangement of some buttons on the toolbox
-when I select a control 8 white little squares appear around the control, could you make them blue when active:P and white when inactive ?(Thanks Jnrz) 
-Double click on Control takes you to where ControlID is in code (Thanks DarkSoul)

V4.0.2.xx
---------
-About box: OK button is now BS_DEFPUSHBUTTON
-Now TriggerWord+one or more spaces and/or Tabs: displays function list w/o any entry selected.(Thanks Qvasimodo/JimG)
	-If TriggerWord needs an opening parenthesis,TriggerWord+( displays function list w/o any entry selected.(Thanks Qvasimodo/JimG)
-I get the line that says the next thing is wtype'' and if I type an "M" then I get the dropdown with the valid entries. What I was asking was if I didn't even know they all started with "M", so I don't know which letter to type, how do I get the dropdown so I can see what is in the list??(Thanks JimG)
-..., I would like an option for Intellisense to say, when I hit return, don't select the item from the dropdown, if I want it I will hit tab or space, return means just give me a carriage return. For example, the same problem occurs if the line ends in hwnd. Actually, now that I think about it, I would like the option to disable the tab key also, so I can just tab over to do a comment. If I want it I will just hit the space bar(Thanks JimG) 

V4.0.1.xx
---------
-Not sure if this is a bug or a "feature"  but when you hit Ctrl+Plus at the AddIn Manager you get to see two hidden columns in the listview. These contain the addins description strings and filenames. They would look better left aligned instead of centered. 

-changing the class of a dialog made the dialog invisible;fixed!

-LANGUAGE Statement outside ACCELERATORS, DIALOGEX, MENU, RCDATA, or STRINGTABLE is now supported too-in these statements it was already supported(Thanks cegy)

-when WS_VISIBLE is not defined for dialogs/controls, the visible property is set to false after styles dialog is used (Thanks JimG)

-Set menu item mnemonics for all Dialog menu item mnemonics, &Recent Projects Manager, F&ind Previous

-The output window doesn't seem to support the usual Ctrl+C hotkey to copy the selected text, it would be nice if it did.(Thanks Qvasimodo)

-Can an option be put in to NOT display a warning every time WinAsm Studio starts with a project that has a .rc file which is not compatible? Maybe on the Options window General tab, place a checkbox "Ignore Incompatible Resource Files".(Thanks curious1)<----Local to the project (Thanks Qvasimodo)

->Intellisense for function names only works if the rest of the line you are typing on is empty(Thanks IanB)
-->remember, that it does not work also when the line begins with label! maybe this bug is at the same part of code(shoorick)
--->A LOT of improvements for intellisense

-In a non invoke line, all constants appear in the local variables and parameters list (thanks shoorick for similar idea)

-New CodeHi control

-After last parameter, tooltip should disappear

-Multi invoke's allowed on a single line with proper tooltip!!! (please try to fool WinAsm Studio and let me know)

-Invoke, InvokeX insert a comma after selecting a function from the list. CALL does NOT insert

-some rare flicker of tooltip removed

-"CALL" tooltip show ALL parameters normall but none is active

-complete rewrite for "Invoke" intelisense

-for "CALL" do NOT highlight any parameter

-After a call do not search for any other trigger word in the same line

-Trigger words may or may not be parameters of other function calls (e.g. call and invoke cannot be in a InvokeX function call)

-matching parenthesis are taken into account

-New tab: Tools-Options-Intellisense

-"Font" property was "F&ont"; fixed

-editing a dialog class name, caused the dialog to disappear from the IDE!

-Should be even faster and flicker free (try  on a long line kepp pressing backspace)

New WAAddIn.inc
-New mebmer of the FEATURES structure: (thanks Qvasimodo)
	phRCEditorWindow	;pointer to hRCEditor MDI Child window e.g.:
						MOV EAX,phRCEditorWindow
						MOV EDX,[EAX]
						;EDX is window handle or 0 if resource file is NOT in Visual mode
						
-New mebmer of the FEATURES structure: (thanks Qvasimodo)
	plpDefinesMem	;Pointer to pointer to resource define statements memory e.g.:
					MOV EAX, plpDefinesMem
					MOV EDX,[EAX]
					;EDX is pointer to define statements memory-->Use [EDX].DEFINE.xxxx
Where,

DEFINE STRUCT
	szName			DB 64+1 DUP(?)
	dwValue			DD ?
	fDeleted		DD ?
DEFINE ENDS

-Second word of line was triggering the varaibles list; now,  if there line starts with a labelpossible label is if current line starts with a label,third word is triggering the list

-Third word ADDS ALL constants in the variables list. (if line starts with a label, 4th word instead of third)
	PhoBOs: you could add a dummy parameter and give ALL sorts of constants NOT already presented in the masmapiconst file e.g.
	dummy=IDABORT,IDCANCEL,IDIGNORE,IDNO,IDOK,IDRETRY,IDYES,INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE,etc etc
	

-Create an empty resource script. Add a new dialog. Right click on the caption bar of the toolbox and change it's style (gradient, single line, or double line). Left click on the newly created dialog. WinAsm causes a page fault, apparently when trying to read from a bad pointer in ECX).(Thanks Qvasimodo)

-A small redrawing issue, when changing the alignment of text in a group box. In the attachment there's a sample of how it looks like when you center the text of a previously left aligned group box(Thanks Qvasimodo) 

V4.0.0.xx
---------
1.WS_CLIPSIBLINGS not set to new controls by deafault (Thanks newman)

2.For example, a new INI file could be added (something like WACustCtrl.ini) with the needed info. In particular, I think all that's really needed for each control is:
1) Control's friendly name
2) Class name of the control.
3) DLL file where the control resides.
4) Optional list of styles supported, and their values. Could be an ASCIIZ array stored with WritePrivateProfileStruct.
The goal would be to integrate custom controls, without having to write them specifically for that task. For example, we could integrate controls made by a third party, whose sources we don't have.
(Thanks Qvasimodo)

3.As a result from 2 above: Controls Manager accessible from Dialog menu OR by right clicking on the toolbox

4.Styles dialog for user controls now in descending order (8000h, 4000h,...,1h  instead of 1h, 2h, 4h,...8000h)

5.Add-Ins manager is disabled when "Configure" button is pressed.

6.Double-clicking to choose from the Recent Projects Manager sometimes causes a GPF (Thanks shoorick).

7.correct context menu placement when keyboard is used for editor windows

8.In the Visual Resource Editor, the edit boxes in the Properties grid don't accept the common shortcuts Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V for Copy and Paste, respectively. This forces users to call the context menu which is not very convenient.(Thanks rubs)

9.Safe mode: Having F8 pressed while WinAsm Studio is launched, prevents any Add-In from loading on startup (Thanks shoorick)

10.After saving new files from the "Save Files" dialog,  the file name changes were not reflected on the project explorer (Thanks Qvasimodo)

11.Should observe a considerable increase in resources loading speed

12.ALT-F4 was destroying docking windows; Now it is NOT!!!

13.correct context menu placement when keyboard is used for docking windows

V3.0.6.xx
---------
-bug with checkboxes fixed(Thanks IanB)

-old fashioned CHECKBOX statement supported (Thanks IanB)

-Closing a child window, now previous one is activated-not next.(Thanks IanB)

-If a dialog is neither WS_CHILD nor WS_POPUP then WS_CAPTION is added automatically both in design mode and Test Dialog. The system also does this(Thanks IanB)

-If a dialog has the DS_CONTROL style, cannot have WS_CAPTION(Thanks IanB)

-The above two cases influence the dialog size

-Creates a window that has a border of a style typically used with dialog boxes. A window with this style cannot have a title bar(Thanks IanB)

-Removed WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW and WS_POPUPWINDOW from the dialog styles' list(Thanks IanB)

V3.0.5.xx
---------
1.shoorick
open wap - asm on top
  2.switch to rc - tools and dialog toolbars opened
  3.close toolbars
  4.switch to asm - you see 3 additional sets of buttons on client area
    (on the gif)

2.shoorick
about a little bug (to your collection ;)

when i delete pathes from the source help popup appears with lib list.
if i just press enter i got such string as upper:

         includelib user32.libb  <<<==
         includelib  \MASM32V1\lib\kernel32.lib
         includelib  \MASM32V1\lib\gdi32.lib
         includelib  \MASM32V1\lib\comctl32.lib

similar efect i've got for incs.
if i select for deleting also one blank space before \MASM..., then
all work proper (?)

to clear experiment i'll attach that source, so try by yourself ;)
select for deleting:
var1:
         includelib  [\MASM32V1\lib\]kernel32.lib
var2:
         includelib [ \MASM32V1\lib\]kernel32.lib

3. Also 'Include->space' was working OK but 'Include->tab' was not. Similarly for Includelib

4.Since this manager appears when studio starts it would be good to have "New" button on it when you wish to create a new project(Thanks shoorick)

5.Sorry for hijacking the post, but I have a question about the manager. I can't seem to catch the event of loading a project from it... for example, the add-in that shows the current project folder is disabled, because it never caught a message indicating that the current project has changed(Thanks Qvasimodo)
	Qvasimodo: New message (WAM_DIFFERENTCURRENTPROJECT) is sent to Add-Ins after the current project is different (even on startup) (e.g. after New Project/Close Project/Open Project etc is processed)   

6.Appropriate messages (IDM_RECENTPROJECTSMANAGER,IDM_OPENPROJECT) are now sent to Add-Ins also on startup(Thanks Qvasimodo)

V3.0.4.184
---------
-when a docking window is open and not docked, even if a modal dialog is open (eg. "options" dialog) it is possible to pass to the non-docked window just by clicking on it.(Thanks blues)
	-similarly about, Add-Ins manager, Project properties, New Project, Open Project dialogs, Print etc etc etc etc
	
-WAM_ENABLEALLDOCKWINDOWS	EQU WM_USER+106	;hWnd   = hMain
                                            ;wParam = 0
                                            ;lParam = TRUE/FALSE 
-About Dialog:
	-Title now reads exact fileversion (x.x.x.x) from compiled winasm.exe
	-Some minor changes to the text disppalyed to cover 16-bit DOS capabilities of WinAsm Studio

-When a NON modal dialog (eg. "find" dialog) is moved to overlap the titlebar of a docking window, then the titlebar is repainted like it is inactive(Thanks blues)

-Status bar s not updated with current selection while in(out)dent or (un)comment takes place-->faster and nicer

-hOut Scrollcaret fix after make

-Some "GetSettingsFromIni" changes let WinAsm Studio start even faster

-A lot of "SaveOptions" changes let WinAsm Studio save options faster

-Files & Paths should have an additional entry: Default Project Path(Thanks DarkSoul,shoorick,JimG)
	Used for
	-save project as							.If ProjectPath[0]	;i.e. project already saved
													MOV ofn.lpstrInitialDir, Offset ProjectPath
												.Else
													MOV ofn.lpstrInitialDir, Offset InitDir
												.EndIf

	-Save files as								.If [EDI].CHILDWINDOWDATA.dwTypeOfFile<101	;i.e. part of the current project
													.If ProjectPath[0]	;i.e. project already saved
														MOV ofn.lpstrInitialDir, Offset ProjectPath
													.Else
														MOV ofn.lpstrInitialDir, Offset InitDir
													.EndIf
												.Else
													.If [EDI].CHILDWINDOWDATA.fNotOnDisk==FALSE
														Invoke lstrcpy, ADDR Buffer, lpFileName
													.Else
														;No!!!!
														;i.e. Initial directory will be WinAsm Studio's folder
														;MOV ofn.lpstrInitialDir, Offset szAppFilePath
														;let it start with recently used folder
													.EndIf
												.EndIf

	
	-Add files									let it start with recently used folder

	-Open Files									let it start with recently used folder
	-New project based on template	WOW!!!		OK




-I would like if the current project dir become default EACH TIME I add file to the project or save as a new file, or add new resources. of course, this may be discussible, but it can be swithable in setup box.
-When project are created a last dir must be updated to project folder immediately, so, if you want to add existing file to project or want to save a new created file a project folder would be proposed as default.
2.i've suggested to make default dir the project dir after it created
immediatelly - you agree, but i thought better while working with
files from other dirs and now i think that project dir must be default
ALWAYS in "add" and "save as" dialogs, because in first time we are
working with our project dir, many project are made from other so
files have same names, after adding a file from well known dir i have
to search this project dir to save - this can lead to some
difficulties (when you are thinking about code not about dirs ;)



-Docking windows: Perfect!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! position for floating windows after WinAsm Studio restert not exactand various fine tunings!!!!

-New optional procedure WAAddInConfig for Add-Ins (Thanks shoorick)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

V3.0.3.21
---------
-What about applying the "Find" tool options to the "Smart Find" function ?
That is, when the "Match Case" check box is checked in the "Find" dialog, use "Mach Case" option while browsing the "Smart Find" result.
All the options can be used : Match Case, Whole Word, Whole Project and direction except FR_CURRENTPROJECT(Thanks PhoBos)

-it would be great to be able delete selected file from the project just with simple pressing "DELETE". (Thanks shoorick)

-I want to add here similar one: when the system is shutting down you may forget about winasm with changes in the tray, and it won't remind you about them (Thanks shoorick)

-Accelerators, String table, Included files & Resources lists: Add/delete LVM_ENSUREVISIBLE

-I always edit a file in several editors at one time.So when I save the changes in one editor,the others should reload the file and show the changes. But when I edit a file in WinASM and another editor,WinASM doesn't show any changes even if I close the same file in WinASM and reopen it. Can WinASM have a function to check the files weither having been modified and give me a choise weither to reload them?(Thanks iceberg)
	-If file modified outside then ask to reload
	-If file deleted/renamed--->user is asked to save when necessary or saved automatically when make is selected

-SS_REALSIZEIMAGE for image cotrols (Thanks shoorick)
	-Various issues when style/exstyle of images or image or size/position changed by the user.

-Various issues when style/exstyle of shapes or size/position changed by the user.
	
-Please, add to WinAsm Studio opportunity auto incrementation version (build number). It is, IMHO, very convenient.(Thanks NetSharp)
	;Takes place only If:
		-FileVersion Auto Increment is selected from version info dialog
		-Go All is used
		-RC file is in Visual mode
		-VerionInfo=1 is taken into account to autoincrement (This is how Windows OS is designed)
		-RC file is considered to be modified after successful Go All and thus user is asked to save it when appropriate
		
-Parent for messagebox of Find (Thanks blues)

-Set WS_TABSTOP for new controls if appropriate (Thanks shoorick)


V3.0.2.9
---------
-Save Project As for a first time project caused Save As dialog to appear twice

-Save project & Save Project As saved wap file even if it was not selected from the AskToSaveFilesDialog

-Recent Projects Dialog :Double click on any item to open a recent project

-Minor bug when adding multiple files that are at root of drive (e.g. c:\) to a project

-May I nag you again about using that WinAsm icon PhoBos made? I just looked at the "about box" and remembered 



V3.0.2.8a
---------
-Tools options General-On StartUp Recent projects was not saved (Thanks blues)

-Esc handling for "Recent Pojects" and "Ask To Save Dialogs" (Thanks blues)

V3.0.2.8
--------
-GoToProc not selecting correctly due to a bug with EM_LINELENGTH

-Selecting from the procedure combo manys time didn't work. Replaced EM_LINEFROMCHAR with EM_EXLINEFROMCHAR in ScrollToTop procedure

-Font of Project tree was not set (Thanks kestrel)

-New version of CodeHi. Scrollbars and grip size read global setting and (automatically) resized (Thanks kestrel)

-Are you aware that if you change the style setting on an edit control to ES_CENTER=yes, the dialog editor does not update the text to look centered on the control?  It works on statics immediately when you change to centered, just not on edit controls.(Thanks JimG)-->I call ReCreateControl proc

-Recreate Tab control after style changes(Thanks Qvasimodo)--->I call ReCreateControl proc

-Project Tab: Double click on .rc file should automatically open the Resources Tab(Thanks DarkSoul)

-Add-Ins can now specify a bitmap to accompany their Add-In menu items (Thanks Qvasimodo)
	-Size: 16x16, Color depth: 256 colors, Mask:0FF00FFh
	-If you use new ADDINMENUITEM structure method to append a new menu item hBitmapNormal must be a valid bitmap handle.hBitmapDisabled is not nessecary.
	-New WAAddIn.inc
	
-The listview columns of the "add-ins manager" are sized without taking in consideration the vertical scrollbar, so if the add-ins are many the vertical scrollbar covers partially the last column and appears also the horizontal scrollbar. it would look better i think if the columns are sized taking in account the possibility of a vertical bar.(Thanks blues)

-Dialog with all modified files: When you close WinASM, if you have made any changes, a dialog pops up with the question "Do you want to save changes to ......" and the options are Yes or No.Sometimes I can't remember if I made a change intentionally, so a Cancel option would be good so I can do a ctrl-z to see what the change was.(Thanks JimG, Marwin, redox, Fotis Katsis)

-OutPut window did not scroll to the end after make is finished

-Sometimes on opening project the first visible line was not the same with that when project had closed before

-EM_xxxx replaced with EM_EXxxxx I had several problems with big files.

-I would be nice to have a confirmation dialog before deleting a dialog box in the resource editor. Could be a life saver if you click "Delete" by accident, and it isn't used all that often for a messagebox to become an annoyance.(Thanks Qvasimodo)

-About Dialog link changed to http://www.winasm.cjb.net

-How about another item in the Help menu, to go to the WinAsm website?(Thanks Qvasimodo)

-Options: On WinAsm StartUp should have an additional entry: Show Recent Projects (I know of the Project Fodler Explorer but I like those things build in)(Thanks DarkSoul)

-New menuitem: File-Recent Projects Manager


V3.0.2.7
--------
-response file used for linking(Thanks Qvasimodo). Therefore:
	-developer has full control on how the project is linked
	-no size limit on link command line

-Serious changes on displaying "Make" output text-->not a character at a time

-Lib.exe is used for building libraries instead of link-->remove -lib command argument from your lib projects
 
-hClient is not hidden/shown when OpenWAP is called (it was very bad). WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGING is used to prevent showing of MDI children while opening a project

-PopUp menu handles are now exported to Add-Ins(Thanks JimG,QvasiModo,DarkSoul,shoorick)

-several changes in openwap to speed up things

-Add the structure CHSELCHANGE to WAAddIn.inc (Thanks PhoBos)

-Also, if you drop down a procedure combobox list (sometimes just to look there), but dont chose anything - a jump is taking anyway - it is also not well (back key will remove unpleasure from it).(Thanks shoorick)

-Save Files As for external files caused an an irrelevant messagebox to popup(Thanks shoorick) 

-There is no way to place a command line to starting exe - sometimes it's necessary.(Thanks shoorick)-Qvasimodo you need to do some work to your New Project Wizard Add-In

-Release n' Debug command line exported to Add-Ins

-Version Info auto increment(Thanks blues)

-Accelerator Tables auto increment

-Changing a Accelerator Table name, the name change was not reflected to the Others TreeView 


V3.0.2.6
--------
-Invoke DestroyAcceleratorTable,hAccel before application closes so that it is destoroyed if hAccel was created in an add-in
-Using tab to go to next column in stringtable dialog caused a gpf under w2k;Fixed(Thanks shoorick)
-Charset used for code editor is now used for all windows that Tahoma font is used.(Thanks shoorick)
-Could it be possible to remove the lines at root in the Project Explorer? With only one root element there's little use for them, and it would save some screen space(Thanks Qvasimodo) 
-would also be nice to go to the previous field with Shift+TAB.(Thanks blues)
-16-bit linking problems solved-"RedStub" not needed any more(Thanks Caleb)
-"Resources" dialog... tab/shift+tab similar behaviour to stringtable dialog(Thanks blues)
-WM_PAINT of Docking windows: Chack If WS_POPUP do nothing
-in the "options" dialog, "editor" tab, when clicking on "show line numbers on open" the checkbox label goes to overlap the other label "show line numbers on error"(Thanks blues)



V3.0.2.5
--------
-In Font Dialog for Dialog resources now Bold,Italics can be selected too.Weird but when compiled font is nver bold even if it is set so I ignore bold when I create the dialog font in design mode
	-When script is generated Bold,Italics,charset are kept
	
-FontSize	DWORD ?
 FontName	DB 32 DUP (?)
 removed from CONTRODATA to DIALOGDATA --->much? faster extraction of dalogs/controls and thus faster project loading


-WinAsm Help-->renamed to WinAsm Studio Help

-About WinAsm-->renamed to About WinAsm Studio

-Any dialog caption changed from "WinAsm ...." to "WinAsm Studio ...."

-Correction in ConvertToPixels (and ConvertToDialogUnits) procedure-->now dialog size in design mode is always exact.

-New Option: Show Line numbers On Open(Thanks shoorick)

-New Option: AutoShow line Numbers On Error(Thanks shoorick)

-Export pointer Accelerator table handle (Thanks shoorick):
	-New WAAddIn.inc
	-See AddNewAcceleratorEntry and RemoveNewAcceleratorEntry sample procedures
	-You can add/remove/edit existing Accelerator entries

-Now a suggesting to a stringlist dialog: is it too do such algorithm?:(Thanks shoorick)
1.push "add" -> new line added and recieves a focus at first column.
2.press tab -> next column same line get focus.
3.press enter or tab in last column -> complete adding, button "add" get focus
This will give ability of fast adding a large stringlist without touching a mouse or any other extra moves (we are too lazy, yeah) 

 
V3.0.2.4
--------
-New CodeHi (should improve scroll of long lines)
-New option: Show Scroll tips
-Commented lines starting with ; now show tab indicators(blues,JimG,QvasiModo)
-Open/Save dialogs should be resizable(Thanks JimG). Also, new style and not always centered.
-May we have an option to desactivate the gradient in the menu's ?(Thanks PhoBos)
-Open Project & Save Project As add entry in recent documents
-replaced many wsprintf with BinToDec or hardcoded values hence:
	-Smaller code
	-Faster code
	-Faster WinAsm Studio exit
-If the resource script has no "END" at the end, switching editor into visual mode hangs IDE. I met this pasting script from example at the web-page. It would be good to prevent such situation.(Thanks shoorick)

-
ppAddInsFrameProcedures				DWORD ?		;Point to pointer to AddInsFrameProcedures list
ppAddInsChildWindowProcedures		DWORD ?		;Point to pointer to AddInsChildWindowProcedures list
ppAddInsProjectExplorerProcedures	DWORD ?		;Point to pointer to AddInsProjectExplorerProcedures list
ppAddInsOutWindowProcedures			DWORD ?		;Point to pointer to AddInsOutWindowProcedures list
are now exported to Add-Ins (Thanks PhoBos, Qvasimodo)


V3.0.2.3
--------
-For New menus:
	-Menu ID				:1000
	-first Menu item Name	: IDM_
	-First Menu item ID		:1001
	-Editing caption of last menu item, add a new menu item at the end(Thanks JimG)
	
	
-New menu items auto increment ID(Thanks JimG)


-Redo works with Ctrl-Y but is not shown as a hotkey on the menu(Thanks JimG)
-when I want to select several controls, I have to press CTRL and click on each control , can you make it like VB ?, it draws a square and whatever control the square touches it gets selected when I release the mouse button(Thanks Jnrz7)
-Auto Toolbox/Dialog Windows change of options name (Thanks JimG)
-F3 for the next search should hide tooltip and any intellisense lists visible (Thanks cbcrack) 
-XP built in 16-bit debugger could not be launched (Thanks kkiawgah)
-Consider searching down with all selected. After you reach the last existing item, dismissing the "specified region has been searched" message, the next time I hit f3, I assumed it would wrap around to the top and continue searching, just as it does when you hit find next in the dialog box for the toolbar search. Does that make sense?(Thanks JimG)
-If a valid (and available during design time) class is set for a UserDefinedControl, then the actual control is displayed.
 

V3.0.2.2
--------

Visual ASM V1.0.0.0
-------------------

This Visual IDE is for programmers using the Assembly Language.
A lot of effort has been done to avoid any bugs but..."99% of 
the time 99% of all the software is correct". So I would be very
greatful if you could send me any bugs you find so that this IDE
become better. Please be strict!


I know that this IDE is quite far from the term "Visual" and many
features are needed to verify this term. Please send any suggestions.

Quick Start:

-To start a new project select "New Project", and from the dialog
choose the appropriate "Project Type" and the "Make Options" (You
can change these later, if you want from Project-->Properties). A new
project is created with one file (untitled.asm). You can add (new or
existing) or remove files from the "Project" menu.

-You are not allowed to save files with names Untitled.* since these
are used by Visual ASM when creating new empty files.
------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 1.0.0.1
---------------

Version 1.0.1.4
---------------
1.Bug Fix: bSelection is now a member of the CHILDWINDOWDATA structure instead
  of global since this would cause troubles if user selects in one child,
  activates another child, presses a key and then goes back to the previous
  child. Pressing a key now wil not refill Procedure List.

2.UpdateProcCombo and UpdateProcList now call GetLineText and GetFirstWordOfLine
  instead of repeating their code (make smaller size).

3.The output window's font now changes according to the Editor font(Thanks Bi_Dark).

4.Small Bug Fix:Tools Manager: If one item left blank then all others following
  are lost(Thanks h4ng4m3).Now they become menu separators.

5.New menu item in Help for the WinAsm help(must be in the Help Directory).

6.Small templates for exe and dll-From New Project Select Template they are
  not saved to recent projects:CORRECT!(Thanks maCo).
  
  Here is the mechanism(Unlimited Templates):
  1.In the WinAsm Directory you must have a directory named Templates.
  2.In the Templates directory you can have as many directories as you want(of courrse!)
    All the names of these directories appear as Tabs in the "New Project" Dialog.
    In the WinAsm package you download there are 3 directories by default. Add as many
    as you wish and you will see their names as new Tabs in the "New Project" Dialog.
    
    In each of these directories you can have as many directories as you
    wish (of course!). For Example in the "Executable" Directory there are 2 directories
    now, namely "SDI" and "MDI". If, and only If, in the "SDI" directory there is
    a project called "SDI.wap" then you see this as template (with the appropriate icon)
    in the "New Project" list in the "Executable" tab. Same logic stands for any template
    you wish to create.
    
    When you select to create a new project based on any template (e.g. the "SDI" template)
    you will be prompted to choose the directory you want the new project to be created in.
  
  3.As you can see the templates are normal WinAsm projects and thus you can open them
    normally (Open Project) if you so wish (e.g to make any changes).

7."Path And File Name" for Assemble,Compile RC, Res To Obj, Definition file and Link

8.Procedure list is not LVS_SHOWSELALWAYS any more.

9.On Minimize Go to system tray is now Optional(Thanks TBD).

10.WinXP Theme support.

11.Clicking on a line where no text was displayed (because of the horizontal
   scrollbar position now CodeHi auto scrolls horizontally(Thanks h4ng4m3).

12.DoEvents	in OpenProject just before OpenWap so that open dialog closes
   before project loading starts(more aesthetic).

13.If there is space before the first variable in procedure declaration then
   we do not get name of variable in tooltip (Modifications done in the
   "FillProceduresList" Procedure).

14.Updated API Files


Version 1.0.1.5
---------------
1.Add-Ins(Thanks eko,TBD).
	
A)The best way to start building Add-Ins for WinAsm is buy choosing File-
New Project-Bare Bone-AddIn. A new project containing the following procedures
will be created:

	a)DllEntry
	----------
	Leave this as it is (a WinAsm Add-In is a Dll after all)
	THIS FUNCTION IS REQUIRED BY ALL VALID WinAsm ADDINS.
	
	b)GetWAAddInData
	----------------
	This procedure must fill in Add-In friendly name and description of what
	this Add-In does.
	THIS FUNCTION IS REQUIRED BY ALL VALID WinAsm ADDINS.
	
	c)WAAddInLoad
	-------------
	Place all one-time initializations here. If all resources are
	successfully allocated, function must return 0. On error, it must free
	partially allocated resources and return -1, in this case Add-In will be
	not be loaded.
	pWinAsmHandles is a pointer to the HANDLES structure (see WAAddIn.inc),
	you will most probably need to keep it. Parameter 'features' is reserved
	for future extentions, do not use it.
	THIS FUNCTION IS REQUIRED BY ALL VALID WinAsm ADDINS.

	
	d)WAAddInUnload
	---------------
	It is called when WinAsm closes and when user selectes to unload the
	Add-In from the WinAsm Add-In Manager. Free all internally allocated
	resources, like window classes, files, memory and so on here.
	THIS FUNCTION IS REQUIRED BY ALL VALID WinAsm ADDINS.
	

	e)FrameWindowProc
	-----------------
	This Procedure receives ALL messages of the Main window. You should
	return 0 if you want WinAsm AND ALL OTHER POSSIBLY LOADED ADDINS to
	process the message otherwise WinAsm AND OTHER POSSIBLY LOADED ADDINS
	will NOT process it.
	If you want to use this procedure you must uncomment it from the WAAddIn.inc
	
	f)ChildWindowProc
	-----------------
	This Procedure receives ALL messages of ALL MDI child windows.
	You should return 0 if you want WinAsm AND ALL OTHER POSSIBLY LOADED
	ADDINS to process the message otherwise WinAsm AND OTHER POSSIBLY LOADED
	ADDINS will NOT process it.
	If you want to use this procedure you must uncomment it from the WAAddIn.inc

	g)ProjectExplorerProc
	---------------------
	This Procedure receives ALL messages of the Project Explorer window.
	You should return 0 if you want WinAsm AND ALL OTHER POSSIBLY LOADED ADDINS
	to process the message otherwise WinAsm AND OTHER POSSIBLY LOADED ADDINS
	will NOT process it.
	If you want to use this procedure you must uncomment it from the WAAddIn.inc
	
	h)OutWindowProc
	---------------
	This Procedure receives ALL messages of the Out window. You should return 0
	if you want WinAsm AND ALL OTHER POSSIBLY LOADED ADDINS to process the
	message otherwise WinAsm AND OTHER POSSIBLY LOADED ADDINS will NOT process it.
	If you want to use this procedure you must uncomment it from the WAAddIn.inc

B)Note the new "Inc" folder in the WinAsm Directory. It includes WAAddIn.inc
(in which you will find all constants, structures etc ). I already know that
more information can be added in this file so I expect suggsestions here.

C)AFTER creating a new Add-In I suggest you go Project-Properties-/OUT and
set the name of your Dll and where it should be created.e.g If your WinAsm
directory is C:\WinAsm you set C:\WinAsm\AddIns\nameofaddin.dll

D)In AddIn.def you change
LIBRARY AddIn -----to-------->LIBRARY nameofaddin.dll

AND uncomment procedure names you will use in your addin:

EXPORTS	GetWAAddInData				<---------Do not comment this
		WAAddInLoad					<---------Do not comment this
		WAAddInUnload				<---------Do not comment this
		;FrameWindowProc			<---------Uncomment this if you are going to use it in your Add-In
		;ChildWindowProc			<---------Uncomment this if you are going to use it in your Add-In
		;ProjectExplorerProc		<---------Uncomment this if you are going to use it in your Add-In
		;OutWindowProc				<---------Uncomment this if you are going to use it in your Add-In


2.Small behaviour change: WinAsm help file was application topmost(Thanks Masmer).

3.In WM_PAINT of Child Window not very good code was "eating" resources.

4.A MesageBox popping up asking if the user really wants remove the
  file (Yes\No)(Thanks Masmer).

5.If project cannot open, do not enable project releated items.

6.If a variable name is the same with structure(not case sensitive then we
  don't get structure parameters for this variable).

7.If a variable name is not the same case with declared variable i should
  not get the structure members list.
  
8.Splash takes a little longer (Thanks FunkyMeister)


Version 1.0.1.6
---------------
1.Intellisense:Structure members of first structure (_SIZE) in Structures list
  were not shown in structure members list.
  
2.Find and Replace buttons on the toolbar(Thanks andrew_k).

11.Updated API Files.


Version 1.0.1.7
---------------
1.All Toolbar, Menu, Project Tree bitmaps now into one bmp file and hence one global
  imagelist. Therefore smaller executable (no doublicate bitmaps) and faster Drawing
  for Owner Drawn menus (no loading-destroying of the image list for every item drawing)
  
2.Due to 1 above, w/o extra bitmaps, I draw bitmaps for more menu items.

3.Bug Fix:(Thanks andrew_k)
1. You need to have a procedure with a local
2. Double click on any word to select it
3. Delete the word
4. Start typing the first few letters of the locals name
5. The intellisense popup will appear. Double click the locals name to
select and insert it from the popup.
6. Now start clicking 'undo' from the toolbar. You can't get back to the
original word.

4.Similarly for Functions replacement (API and Project Functions).

   Structures
   
14.Procedures Tab in Project Explorer renamed to Blocks and the corresponding
   List displays Procedures, macros and structures now (Thanks masquer).
   
15.Minor changes to Find and Replace bitmaps (Thanks andrew_k)

Version 2.0.0.0
---------------
1.Image for Blocks Tab Item.

2.Use quotes for /Out switch so that project can be built to any folder
  with any name (when there are spaces)-(Thanks SOL_bl, andrew_k).



3.Exernal tools are now executed with ShellExecute (Thanks P2M)

4.Minimum height and width of main window set to 220 pixels.

5.Print Dialog Screen center (Thanks andrew_k).

7.Project Explorer and Out Parent are now Docking/float windows.(Thanks Maco, Manos, eko)
Notes:
a).Custom title bar styles;Right-click on the non client area and
  choose the title style from the context menu. 
b).Pressing Ctrl while moving prevents docking (Always float)
c).Double clicking on a docked window converts it to float (last float pos and size)

8.Esc hides the output window (Thanks SOL_bl)

9.Much more comprehensive MasmApiCall.vaa (Thanks PhoBos). The previous renamed to
  MasmApiCallLt.vaa for those who might have startup speed problems.

10.Some more bitmapped menu items and CodeHi different images (Thanks andrew_k for the images).


Version 2.0.0.1
---------------

1.256 color bitmaps used instead of 16-color.(Thanks andrew_k and PhoBos for the help)

2.Procedure Combo form 150 pixels now 250 pixels hide (helps for Win98SE)

2.Procedure Auto Complete: Dafault, Uppercase, Lowercase options for RET and EndP.(Thanks andrew_k)

2.0.0.1 UPDATES
---------------
1.When sizing a float window, some minor position problem occured
2.A bit improvement on toolbar bitmaps (Thanks andrew_k)


Version 2.0.0.2
---------------
1.Docking Windows are not based on "hActiveDock" any more but a Block of memory keeps
  information for the docking windows "turn".

2.If Intellisense Pop up is visible Esc hides it. Otherwise output window will hide(Thanks PhoBos)

3.Project Properties & Tools-Options Dialogs background color when XP theme was used.(Thanks TBD)

4. When you right click on a Block name the popup menu includes
   an item that would let you goto the declaration line of that object.
   Also option for going back.
   This should make analysing large programs less painful.(Thanks JohnnyQuest)
   
   Removed: Double clicking on the selection bar on a line that corresponds to a PROTO
   declaration and you will automatically taken to the corresponding procedure
   not needed any more.

   andrew_k should make minor changes to AddProc and AddMacro Add-Ins to take care of the
   increase in menu items.
    
5.Docking Windows context menu now appears only on non-"client" area.

6.Much better support for showing/hiding docking windows with
  .ElseIf uMsg==WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED
  
7.WinAsm can handle ANY number of Docking Windows, so I decided to export this
  capability to Add-Ins. Three new messages are applicable for this purpose (Please
  see attached WAAddin.inc):
  
  a)WAM_CREATEDOCKINGWINDOW: Send this message to ***hMain*** to create a new
  docking window; The return value is the window handle of the newly created Add-In,
  hWnd   = hMain
  wParam = Window Style, recommend (WS_VISIBLE OR WS_CLIPCHILDREN or WS_CLIPSIBLINGS or WS_CHILD or STYLE_xxx)
          WS_CHILD is a must!
  lParam = lpDockData (LPDOCKINGDATA)
  
  
  b)WAM_GETCLIENTRECT: Send this message to the handle you obtained from
   (a) above the get the client rectangle of the docking window. Do not use any
   other method you are aware of to get this rectangle!
   hWnd   = hAddInWindow
   wParam = 0
   lParam = lpRect (LPRECT)

  c)WAM_DESTROYDOCKINGWINDOW: Send this message to the handle you obtained from
  (a) above to destroy your Docking window. DO NOT USE any other method you are aware of to destroy it!
   hWnd   = hAddInWindow
   wParam = 0
   lParam = 0
   
  Note: Pressing x on the Docking window does NOT destroy your docking window.
  It simply hides it. Use (c) above to destroy it if you so wish!


V2.0.0.2 Update 2 (I lost the changes of Update 1-very minor)
------------------------------------------------------------
1.In WM_SIZE of Project Explorer I use this:
			Invoke GetWindowLong,hProjectTree,GWL_STYLE
			PUSH EAX
			or EAX,TVS_NOTOOLTIPS
			Invoke SetWindowLong,hProjectTree,GWL_STYLE,EAX
			POP EAX
			Invoke SetWindowLong,hProjectTree,GWL_STYLE,EAX
	
	so that Tree tooltips are not hidden behind the docking window when it floats.
	
2.In Docking window procedure
	.ElseIf uMsg == WM_NOTIFY
		MOV EAX,lParam

		.If [EAX].NMHDR.code==TTN_NEEDTEXT
			Invoke SetWindowPos,[EAX].NMHDR.hwndFrom,HWND_TOP,0,0,0,0,SWP_NOACTIVATE OR SWP_NOMOVE or SWP_NOSIZE or SWP_NOOWNERZORDER
		.EndIf
	so that Toolbar tooltips are not hidden behind the docking window when it floats.

3.Invoke DrawCaption, hClient,... in ODMenus instead of hWnd of desktop window because sometimes there is text (Thanks Jnrz) 


V2.0.0.2 UPDATE3
----------------
1.WinAsm hangs if Macro or struct at line=0 and no more lines in any asm or inc file (Thanks JohnyQuest)

5.	.ElseIf EAX >50000
	changed to .ElseIf EAX >50000 && EAX<=ExternalFilesMenuID
	and the bad crash when minimixing,maximizing and pressing X MDI children removed!

6.Caret of CodeHi is now shown even if user selects from Project tree

7.MDI Children now process WM_MDIACTIVATE and WM_SETFOCUS;  and not WM_SETFOCUS || EAX==WM_MOUSEACTIVATE
