# WinAsm Studio #

WinAsm Studio is now an opensource Integrated Development Environment IDE for developing 32-bit Windows and 16-bit DOS programs using the Assembler. The Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) is supported inherently, while the FASM Add-In adds support for FASM and other assemblers.

WinAsm Studio is optimized for size and speed, yet contains many useful features such as intellisense which will assist you in creating Windows API based programs. Highly extensible via user-created add-ins. Includes a powerful Visual Resource Editor.

WinAsm Studio is a Multilingual User Interface (MUI) application meaning that you can set everything of its GUI to be displayed in the language of your choice. It has already been translated to many languages; You are more than welcome to make or help with the translation to your native one.
